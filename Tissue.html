(a) Tracheids, (b) Vessels, (c) Xylem parenchyma and 
(d) Xylem fibres  
(a)  Tracheids - They carry  water from root to leaf 
through stem. 
(b)  Vessels - They carry water and mineral salts from 
the root of plants to the leaf. 
(c)  Xylem fibres- They mainly provide mechanical 
support to plants. 
(d)  Xylem parenchyma- Radial conduction of water 
takes place by xylem parenchymatous cell.</div>
