<div id="wrong428" class="wrong">Incorrect. The involuntary muscles are located in heart 
of a human body. On the basis of structure and 
function, there are three types of muscle tissue 
recognized in vertebrates: 
(1)  Voluntary muscles:  They anchored to bone by 
tendons,that is why they are also called Skeletal 
muscles. They are used to effect skeletal movement 
in activities such as locomotion and maintaining 
posture.  These muscles are responsible to react to 
conscious control of human, so they are known as 
voluntary muscles.
