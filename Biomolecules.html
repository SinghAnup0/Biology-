<div id="answer20" class="answer">Correct! The blood group of the man is A, which 
means the possible genotypes are 'IA IA' or 'IA i'. 
Likewise, the blood group of the woman is B, which 
means the possible genotypes are 'IB IB' or 'IB i'. 
Hence, A man with blood group A, married to a woman 
with blood group B, then the possible blood groups are 
'A', 'B', 'AB', and 'O' because gene for blood group 'A' 
and gene for blood group B are both dominant.</div>
