as sugar, plants capture light energy and use it to 
convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into 
oxygen and glucose. There are generally four steps 
of the photosynthesis process − 
Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll, light 
energy converted into chemical energy, splitting of 
water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen, and 
carbon dioxide reduced to carbohydrates.</div>

on another agent to cause the transfer of pollen. The 
agents of pollination include birds, animals, water, 
wind, and insects. Based on the agent of pollination, 
cross-pollination can be of different types: 
(1)  Hydrophilous 
flowers-These 
flowers 
are 
pollinated by water means. 
(2)  Zoophilous flowers– In this type of pollination, the 
pollinating agents are animals like human beings, 
bats, birds etc.

<div id="wrong130" class="wrong">Incorrect. Pollination takes two forms: 
(1) Self pollination 
(2) Cross pollination  
Self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther 
is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or 
another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is 
the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to 
the stigma of another flower on a different individual of 
the same species. Cross-pollination is always dependant 
on another agent to cause the transfer of pollen. The 
agents of pollination include birds, animals, water, 
wind, and insects. Based on the agent of pollination,
