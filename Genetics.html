<div id="wrong31" class="wrong">Incorrect. Inheritance can be defined as the process of how 
a child receives genetic information from the parent. The 
whole process of heredity is dependent upon inheritance 
and it is the reason that the offsprings are similar to the 
parents. This simply means that due to inheritance, the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
family 
possess 
similar
